# SKJI-113-SKILLRAACE-JAVA-INTERNSHIP-PHASE-2-TASKS-SKILLRAACE
SKILLRAACE JAVA INTERNSHIP. It consist of the java code for Phase 2 tasks. Phase 2 tasks are divided into two parts as TASK 2A and TASK 2B.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

************** *TASK 2A Description:* ************
**Task Description**
The task is to write a Java program that calculates the sum of odd and even digits in a given long integer. The program takes a single long integer as input and outputs the sum of the odd digits and the sum of the even digits. The output must display the sums separated by a space.

**Features of the Code**
User Input: The program reads a long integer from the user.
Digit Processing: It processes each digit of the number to determine if it's odd or even.
Sum Calculation: It maintains separate sums for odd and even digits.
Output: The program outputs the sums of odd and even digits.

**Working**
Initialization: The program initializes a Scanner object to read user input and two variables (sumOfOddDigits and sumOfEvenDigits) to store the sums of odd and even digits, respectively.

Input Reading: It prompts the user to enter a number and reads the input as a long integer.

Digit Extraction and Sum Calculation:

The program uses a while loop to process each digit of the number.
It extracts the last digit using the modulus operator (%).
It checks if the digit is even or odd by using the modulus operator with 2.
Depending on the result, it adds the digit to either sumOfEvenDigits or sumOfOddDigits.
It then removes the last digit from the number using integer division by 10.
Output: After processing all digits, the program prints the sums of odd and even digits separated by a space.



************** *TASK 2B Description:* ************
**Task Description**
The program has the following features:

It takes a long integer input representing the given integer.
It uses a while loop to extract each digit from the integer.
It checks whether each digit is 4 using the equality operator.
If the digit is 4, it increments the count variable.
It prints the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the integer.
The program works as follows:

**Working**
It takes a long integer input representing the given integer.
It initializes a variable count to 0, which will be used to store the number of occurrences of the digit 4.
It uses a while loop to extract each digit from the integer.
It checks whether each digit is 4 using the equality operator.
If the digit is 4, it increments the count variable.
It prints the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the integer.
The program has the following steps for execution:

**Execution**
Save the code in a file named "task2b.java".
Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
Compile the program by typing "javac task2b.java" and pressing enter.
Run the program by typing "java task2b" and pressing enter.
Enter the integer when prompted.
The program will display the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the integer.
This program can be used to count the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in a large integer, which can be useful in various mathematical and analytical applications. 
The program can be easily modified to count the number of occurrences of any other digit by changing the digit value in the if statement.
